# Libraries and Packages
## What?
Libraries are distributed packages. Packages are just encapsulated code environments.

## Why?
Packages allow components to live together without conflicting. Libraries allow developers to share packages.

## How?
Any combination of components in a document is a "package" (whereas, a standard application should have many). One or more packages uploaded to NPM becomes a library.
